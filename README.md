## Description

LedgerLodge revolutionizes the experience of credential sharing with a unique blend of gamification and security. By harnessing the power of TBD's decentralized identity SDK, it seamlessly manages verifiable credentials within a user-friendly, virtual environment. Users can securely store their credentials on local Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN), crafting personalized public rooms adorned with virtual furniture to display these credentials. This innovative platform facilitates effortless sharing of public credentials between users via DWN, merging reliability with interactive engagement.

## How it works
